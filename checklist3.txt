Week 3

Functional specification (what the project will do) is complete: Ok

There is some design documentation (key classes, mechanisms, protocols): Ok

Keep working on this

There are sufficient issues to keep each team member busy for week 4: Partial

Good number of issues, but they need to be assigned to people.

Each team member has closed at least two issues and has put the closed issue number(s) in their report: No

No report from Anique, Menon
No closed issue list from Vishaal
Not clear from Charlene's report whether those issues were worked on or closed

The project builds and does something useful. Put instructions for building and for trying out that useful feature on the wiki: Partial

Tell me what's working now
